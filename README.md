### 3D RANSAC and Hough transform implementations

I implemented a code to generate 3D points on a hyperplane. Given a desired number of 3D points and a hyperplane parameters, a set of 3D points that represent a hyperplane will be generated. There is a parameter epsilon that determines the boundaries of noise that will be added to the 3D points. The noise will be generated independently for each dimension and for each data point.
